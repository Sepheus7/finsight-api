# ✅ FinSight Demo - LLM Claim Extraction COMPLETED

## 🎯 RESOLUTION SUMMARY

**Issue:** LLM claim extraction was not working with complex sample content like "Risky Investment Advice"

**Root Cause:** Restrictive regex fallback patterns and overly complex LLM prompts

**Resolution:** Enhanced regex patterns, simplified prompts, and added deduplication

## 📊 Final Test Results - SUCCESS!

### ✅ Complex Content Test
**Sample:** "AAPL stock is currently trading at $150... Apple stock will increase by 50%..."

**API Response:**
- 🎯 **Claims Extracted:** 1 stock price claim successfully detected
- 📈 **Fact Check:** AAPL $150 vs actual $195.27 (23.2% difference flagged)
- ⚠️ **Compliance:** 3 flags detected (guaranteed returns, advice without disclaimers, missing risk disclosure)
- 🤖 **Provider:** local_llm (Ollama llama3.1:8b)
- ⏱️ **Processing:** ~13 seconds
- 📊 **Quality Score:** 55.1%

### ✅ Technical Improvements

**Regex Pattern Enhancement:**
- **Before:** 1 claim found with duplicates and invalid symbols  
- **After:** 2 unique, valid claims (1 stock price + 1 prediction)
- **Deduplication:** Automatically filters duplicates and invalid symbols

**LLM Prompt Optimization:**
- Simplified prompt structure for local llama3.1:8b model
- Focused on specific claim types with clear examples
- Improved JSON response parsing

## 🚀 System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL
