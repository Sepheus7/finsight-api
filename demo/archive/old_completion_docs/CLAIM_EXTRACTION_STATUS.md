### 🎭 User Experience Issues (NOT technical failures)

**Why users might think "claims aren't being extracted":**

1. **⏱️ Processing Time**: Users don't wait 3-10 seconds for LLM analysis
2. **📍 Looking in Wrong Place**: Claims appear in "Fact Check Results" section
3. **📝 Content Dependent**: Some samples don't have explicit extractable claims
4. **🔄 Inconsistent LLM**: Same content might extract different claims each time

### 🛠️ Frontend Testing Instructions

To test claim extraction in the browser:

1. **Open**: http://localhost:8080/demo-fixed.html

   ```

   Microsoft (MSFT) shares cost $350 per share.
   Tesla stock is worth $200.
   ```
