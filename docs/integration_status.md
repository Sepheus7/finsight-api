- Direct API test: ✅ World Bank API accessible
- GDP data endpoint: ✅ Responding correctly
- Rate limits: ✅ Within acceptable range

**Implementation:** Available in `src/integrations/world_bank_client.py`

### 📊 Alpha Vantage Integration

Status: 🔑 NO_API_KEY (Ready for Use)

✅ **Ready Features:**

- Client implementation complete
- Rate limiting implemented (5 req/min)
- Stock quotes and company overview support
- Error handling and fallback logic

## 🔄 Data Aggregator Performance

Status: 🟢 EXCELLENT

The unified Data Aggregator successfully:

- ✅ Retrieves stock data from Yahoo Finance (primary)
- ✅ Implements fallback to Alpha Vantage (when API key available)
- ✅ Provides caching with 1-hour TTL
- ✅ Handles async operations correctly
- ✅ Returns structured StockData objects

   - Update import statements to work with current module structure

### Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-Validation**
   - Implement price comparison between Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage
   - Add confidence scoring based on source agreement

2. **Economic Context**
   - Integrate World Bank economic indicators with stock analysis
   - Add GDP, inflation context to financial fact-checking

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Current Working Integration

```python
from integrations.data_aggregator import DataAggregator

async with DataAggregator() as aggregator:
    stock_data = await aggregator.get_stock_data("AAPL")
    print(f"AAPL: ${stock_data.price} ({stock_data.change_percent:+.2f}%)")
```

### With Alpha Vantage (when API key set)

```bash
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
# Automatic fallback to Alpha Vantage if Yahoo Finance fails
```

### World Bank Direct API

```python
import requests
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/US/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD",
    params={"format": "json", "date": "2020:2023"}
)
```
